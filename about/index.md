Software developer. Interested in low level programming and security,
although my programming experience has been mostly related with web
development (I'm a Django big fan!) and some other Python
(my preferred programming language) applications.

I love working with Free/Open Source technologies and being able to
contribute to them. Always involved in several personal projects,
I enjoy trying new technologies and learning something new everyday.
I like to spend my free time with friends, playing the guitar,
reading or playing soccer.

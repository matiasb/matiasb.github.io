***Carpe diem*** is a phrase from a [Latin][1] poem by [Horace][2]. It is popularly translated as **&#8220;seize the day&#8221;**. The general definition of *carpe* is &#8220;pick, pluck, pluck off, gather&#8221; as in plucking, although Horace uses the word in the sense of &#8220;enjoy, make use of, seize&#8221;. When actually translated into English, &#8220;Carpe Diem&#8221; means **to pluck day**. Seize the day is not actually the correct term. All it&#8217;s actually saying is life is short don&#8217;t let it pass you by and to live life to its fullest.
